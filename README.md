# TeamEngine Java code test

### Building & running
The project uses Maven for dependency managment and using Maven is the recommended way of setting it up. It should run fine without but that would require you to manually add the dependencies listed in the pom.xml.

Main.java will run the three tasks defined in the se.teamengine.java.test.tasks namespace.

### Tasks
There are three tasks in the se.teamengine.java.test.tasks namespace. 

Task 1 is a simulation of a API call made with a HMAC-signed JSON payload. Your task is to get the run() method to return true. Note that the HMacUtil class can be used to generate an HMAC as well as vaidate one.

Task 2 is a test of validating a inputted username & password using a database where passwords are encrypted. 

Task 3 should have the example_file.pdf already loaded in to PDFBox and your task is to list the table of contents in the file.


### Other
Any questions regarding setting up the project & getting it to run can be emailed direclty to dara@teamengine.se 

We expect you to have made attemps to solve all tasks when handing in your code.
